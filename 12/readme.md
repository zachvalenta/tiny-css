# Chapter 12: Using Preprocessors

## Getting started

### Option 1: Using npm

1. Install the dependencies. From the root of the project run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the Sass watcher. This will listen for changes in the `.scss` files (both in the before and after folders), and compile the CSS on save.
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open the [`./before/index.html` file](./before/index.html) in a modern browser.

### Option 2: In Codepen

Follow setup instruction found in the first section of chapter 13.
